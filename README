GENERAL INFORMATION:

This is a set of script to list TOR hidden services. An up-to-date copy can be downloaded at https://github.com/DanWin/onion-link-list

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:

You'll need to have php with pdo_mysql, pcre, json and date extension, a web-server and a MySQL server installed.
When you have everything installed, you'll have to create a database and a user for the script.
Then edit the configuration in common_config.php to reflect the appropriate database settings and to modify the settings the way you like them.
Then copy the scripts to your web-server directory and open the setup.php script like this: http://(server)/setup.php
Note: If you updated the script, please visit http://(server)/setup.php again, to make sure, that any database changes are applied and no errors occure.
At last set up cron jobs for update.php phishing_tests.php and background_tests.php
Recommended schedule:
update.php - every 24 hours
phishing_tests.php - every 24 hours, shortly after update.php
background_tests.php - every 15 minutes

TRANSLATING:

Copy lang_en.php and rename it to lang_YOUR_LANGCODE.php
Then edit the file and translate the messages into your language and change $I to $T at the top.
If you ever use a ' character, you have to escape it by using \' instead or the script will fail.
When you are done, you have to edit common_config.php, to include your translation. Simply add a line with
		'lang_code' => 'Language name',
to the $L array below the settings, similar to what I did for the German translation.
Please share your translation with me, so I can add it to the official version.
To update your translation, you can copy each new string to your translation file or edit the automated lang_update.php script to reflect you language and run it.

LIVE DEMO:

If you want to see the scripts in action, you can visit my TOR hidden service http://tt3j2x4k5ycaa5zt.onion/onions.php or via a tor2web proxy like http://tt3j2x4k5ycaa5zt.onion.to/onions.php if you don't have TOR installed.
